Статус-страница проекта Rusdracor: Fathers, Mothers, children


# Done 

* We met with Frank and discuss our workflow.
* We forked rusdracor to dhhse and discussed how to edit, commit and push commits in TEI-files.
* We labeled 6 dramas and found a bug with the schema (Frank wrote to Ingo).
* We started a spreadSheet https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1tPmjl1jZrdz8x6hitzjp48XycPxaBz37OoXI2_rzdWo/edit?ts=5dd2fb0d#gid=0. Here we write out relation labels, done explicitly, and mark labels, which is clear (or checked) out of context.


# Next step (16-18th of December)

* Mark with relation labels at least 20 dramas.
* Keep on doing the spreadSheet.
* Meet Frank and discuss the prodgress, mistakes, problems, ideas.


# Further Steps:

## MVP
* Add relation labels to all Russian Dramas.
 
## EP
* Make a visualisation of relatives' connections.
 
## HAP
* Create an API.
